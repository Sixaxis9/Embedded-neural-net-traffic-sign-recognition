# Embedded neural net traffic sign recognition
Traffic sign recognition performed by a convolutional neural network deployed on a STM32 microcontroller.


All the python code to train Keras Model, export and convert them to TFLite and NNoM models is in the "Jupyter" folder.
The templates to implement Keras, Tensorflow Lite and NNoM models on STM32 using CubeIDE are in the "Firmware" folder.

Further information are provided in the respective subfolder.
